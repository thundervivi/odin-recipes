        <h2 class="heading">Description</h2>
        <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty
            , made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. 
            A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but 
            my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan
            . I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.
